  My first website was just made before a few seconds.
  I'm studying <strong>how to make some strings <u>bold</u></strong>.
  "Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines
  and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields"</p>

  <p>Look at the above photo which I found at the website providing free pictures. It looks yummy!!!! I want to bake some bread or cookie by going back to my home TT.
  I add some grammar following tutorials.Now I will try to add a new line. So, according to teacher's recommendation of search text, I researched how to make a new line.
  So I will test whether my search is right. 다음 강의의 내용은 뭘까요?</p>
  <p>다음 강의의 내용은 바로 링크 태그였습니다.
